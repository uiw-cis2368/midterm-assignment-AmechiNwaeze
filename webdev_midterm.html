            <h1 class="charactertitle">"Extraordinary Super Warrior" Super Saiyan Goku</h1>
            <p>
<pre>
This character is amongst one of the newest released characters from the Dragon Ball <i>Coolers Revenge</i> Movie
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dbz-dokkanbattle/images/a/a8/Card_1024860_thumb_apng.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/255?cb=20220829152435" alt="" width="255" height="255">
He boasts an incredible defense with his blocking while having <stong>one of</stong> the highest attack stats in the game.
He gives you a second chance in battle with his revival skill and has a cool animation for that and his active skill attack.
</p>
<p>
This character features:
    <ul class="description">
        <i>
<li>200% leader skill (HP, Attack, and Defense) for <i>Powerfull Comeback Allies</i></li>
<li>Stacks Defense every turn with his Ultra Super Attack</li>
<li>Passive Attack boost from 159% to 218%</li>
<li>Passive Defense boost from 159% to 218%</li>
<li>Passive Ki boost up to 5</li>
<li>Guard that activates when HP is above 59% (start of turn)</li>
<li>Revival skill that activates when HP is below 59% (start of turn)</li>
<li>Active skill attack that does <i>Ultimate</i> damage and delays an enemy action while temporarily raising attack greatly</li>
        </i>
    </ul>

This character is good for events all around and is a must have unit for the Red Zone events. Although his team
(Powerful Comeback) is pretty specific and few other than him is viable in Red Zone. Although if they are viable, chances
are they are a top tier unit as well such as Ultimate Gohan.

        <h2 class="charactertitle">"Planet-Crushing Blow" Cooler (Final Form)</h2>
            <p>
<pre>
This is another new unit from the <i>Coolers Revenge</i> movie.

Cooler is an absolute beast with <em>the highest</em> attack stat in the game. He also loves to use super attacks
multiple times.

This unit features:
<ul class="description">
    <i>
<li>170% leader skill (HP, Attack and Defense) for <i>Terrifying Conquerors</i> and <i>Movie Bosses</i>
or 200% for those that are also <i>Transformation Boost</i></li>
<li>Stacks Attack every turn on Ultra Super Attack usage</li>
<li>A dope <i>Entrance Animation (The coolest one by far in my opinion)</i></li>
<li>Passive Attack and Defense boost of 100% up to 200%</li>
<li>Ki boost of 5 up to 10</li>
<li>Launches from 2 up to 5 additional attacks in turn</li>
    </i>
</ul>

This unit is an all-around great unit, but he is definitely better suited for longer events such as <i>Red Zone</i>,
<i>Fighting Legend Goku</i>, or <i>Fighting Legend Vegeta</i>. He makes the now meta <i>Wicked Bloodline</i> team 
very viable and he devastates the enemy's health bars. His only weakness is that he takes 10 attacks in order to 
hit his 200% passive boost.
